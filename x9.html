Note that your x-coordinate never changes, so you have to be put ...

Now you need only two points to draw the graph of a linear equation. First. let x = 0 then solve for y. First point is (0,-3) Now let y = 0 and solve for x. Add 3 to both sides. Multiply both sides by -2. Second point is (-6, 0) Now plot these two point on your graph paper and draw a straight line through them. You should get the graph shown here:

9/8/2016 · This is the equation of the y-axis. It is a vertical line through the origin. Any vertical line has the equation x = square This is because it only has an x-intercept and does not intersect they-axis. Vertical lines cannot be written in standard form because the slope is undefined. The equation of the line is given by the x-intercept of the line. In this case x=0 goes though the origin (x=0 ...

The graph is a parabola which opens upwards. Clearly, the graph is symmetrical about the y-axis. So, the equation of the axis of symmetry is x = 0. The minimum value of y is 3 and it occurs when x = 0. The vertex of the parabola is the point (0, 3). In general: Graphs of y = ax² + c, a < 0 Example 6. Solution:

Did you plot a few points? I plotted the points that satisfy y = -6 and x = 0, x = 1, x = -1 and x = 4. All these points are 6 units below the X-axis. In fact every point that is 6 units below the X-axis has its Y-value equal to -6. Thus that's the graph of y = -6, all the points in the plane that are 6 units below the X-axis. Penny

The graph of a function f is the set of all points in the plane of the form (x, f(x)). We could also define the graph of f to be the graph of the equation y = f(x). So, the graph of a function if a special case of the graph of an equation. If you want to see a graph of your function just enter it in the box below.

8/8/2015 · Well the easiest way to graph a 2d line is to put it in the form [math]y = mx + b[/math] This form is so useful because b is the y intercept of the graph and m is the slope of the graph. So the first thing you would do is solve for y [math]x ...

The first step would be to get x-3y=6 out of standard form and into y=mx+b form, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. To do this, we need to get y by itself on one side.x-3y=6-x -x-3y ...

10/21/2013 · If you ever need to graph an equation you can just plug in a number and then find the other. In this case you have x+y=0, if you plug in 5 for x, then y will have to be -5 because 5+-5=0. Do 3 samples like so to get a accurate graphed line, if you only do 2 and you made a mistake in one of them then you have the wrong line.

In the Cartesian plane, * horizontal line is called x-axis and the vertical line is called y-axis, * coordinate axes divide the plane into four parts called quadrants, * point of intersection of the axes is called the origin * coordinates of the o...

To locate the local maxima and minima from a graph, we need to observe the graph to determine where the graph attains its highest and lowest points, respectively, within an open interval. Like the summit of a roller coaster, the graph of a function is higher at a local maximum than at nearby points on both sides.

The interval [0 , + inf) is closed at x = 0 and the graph shows a "closed point". As x becomes very small, 1 / x approaches zero. As x becomes very large, e-x also approaches zero. Hence the line y = 0 is a horizontal asymptote to the graph of f. From the graph of f shown below, we can observe that function f can take all real values on (- inf ...

If the function is defined for only a few input values, then the graph of the function is only a few points, where the x-coordinate of each point is an input value and the y-coordinate of each point is the corresponding output value. For example, the black dots on the graph in Figure \(\PageIndex{10}\) tell us that \(f(0)=2\) and \(f(6)=1\).
